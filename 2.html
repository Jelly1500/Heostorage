  <h2>Life, ì‚¶</h2>
  Life is just like wind. <p>Already happened in my life is need to let go.</p>
  Can you hold on to the wind We've passed? No. Just let go. And focus the
  current. We need to know what we can do right now. And do. It is Life.
  <p>Thank you for Listening, and have a nice day!</p>
