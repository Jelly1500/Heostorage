  <h2>Realization, 깨달음</h2>

  When I felt frustration, I think I was wrong. To be specific, I feel
  My road is wrong, and I <strong> <u> select </u> way </strong>. <br>But I found the way,
  and I know one thing. This world, This system aren't have answer.
  Each way is right answer.
  So I'll try to get out of my frustration.
  <p>Thank you for listening, and have a nice day</p>
