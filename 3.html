  <h2>My story, 내 이야기</h2>
  Um... I want to tall you my happy accident. Today
  is little special. I failed to get into college. Maybe this accident gave me
  to think about the life. So I am calm now. To be honest, I was a little shocked
  at the time. It was a little... hard. <p>However, it was harder to cling to an irreplaceable past.</p>
  Now I really calm down. <p>Thank you for Listening, and have a nice day!</p>
